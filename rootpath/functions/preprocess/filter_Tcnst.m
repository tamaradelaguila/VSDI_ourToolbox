% OF WAVES (1Dinput) OR PIXELS OF MOVIES (3Dinput)

% The function that does the actual calculation is the attached  Tcnst1. 
% It uses 'weight' number of previous timepoints to smooth. The first points are smoothed in a reversed way, using next timepoints 
% input: one timeserie( Wave)
% weight: of the Tcnst filtering ~ timespan used to smooth (see below)
% output: filtered timeserie or movie

% Change the Temporal Information of the Wave Chart

% (D(t): value of wave chart before calculation
%  D'(t): value of wave chart after calculationt: time
% 
% When Tcnst=1, D'(t) = D(t)*1
% When Tcnst=2, D'(t) = D(t)*0.9 + D’(t-1)*0.1

% ???
% When Tcnst=10 D'(t) = D(t)*0.1 + D’(t-1)*0.9
